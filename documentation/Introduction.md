# Angular
AngularJS is based on the *model view controller*, whereas Angular 4 is based on the components structure. Angular 6 works on the same structure as Angular4 but is faster when compared to Angular4.
*Angular6 uses TypeScript 2.9* version whereas *Angular 4 uses TypeScript version 2.2.* This brings a lot of difference in the performance.
# What is new in Angular 6
Before discussing about the Angular 6 we need to understand about the Angular 5 features and will try see the changes and enhancement that was done in Angular 6.
# Angular 5 and its Features
Angular 5 was released in Nov 2017 with the objective to increase the speed and reduce its size. It was faster and smaller  in size then the Angular 4.
Following are the features that were introduced in Angular 5.
### 1. HttpClient API
*HttpClient* API was introduced to deprecate the HTTP library. HttpClient API is much *faster*, *secure* and *efficient* than HTTP library.
### 2. Multiple export Aliases
A component can be exported using multiple aliases to ease the migartion process.
### 3. Internationalized Pipes
Angular 5 was introduced with the internationalized Pipes for Number, Date, and Currency- New pipes was introduced for better standardization.
### 4. Lamda Support
Lammbda experssions with proper names can be used instead of functions.
### 5. Buid optimizer
Build optimizer introduced. It *optimizes the build size and improves the application speed*. Angular CLI uses Build Optimzer automatically.
### 6. Improved Complier
Compiler from Angular 5 onwards supports incremental compilation leading for faster compilation.Complier uses TypeScript transforms, a new feature of TypeScript 2.3 available onwards.

That was all about the *Angular 5* major features, now let's discuss about the Angular 6 features.
# Angular 6 and its Features
### 1. Updated Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)
There were lots of new command added in Angular 6. Like *ng-update* to migrate from previous version to current version.
ng-add to quickly add application features to make application a progressive web apps.
### 2. Updated CDK (Component Development Kit)
Supports creating custom UI elements without need of angular material library.Supports responsive web design layouts. Supports overlay packages to create pop-ups.
### 3. Updated Angular material
New tree componenet added, mat-tree, a styled version and cdk-tree, a unstyled version, to represent a hierarchical structure like tree.
### 4. Usage Of RxJS(a reactive JS library)
*The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript (RxJS)* is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences and LINQ-style query operators.
### 5. Angular Element
Allows Angular Components to be published as Web Components which can then be used in any HTML page.
Using angular Element package, native custom elements can be created easily.
### 6. Multiple Validatiors
Allows multiple validators to be applicable on a form builder.
### 7. Tree Shaking on Services
Now tree shaking can be applied on services as well to remove the dead code.
